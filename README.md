# Mercury's Perihelion Precession Analysis ðŸŒŒ

## Overview
This project analyzes the precession of Mercury's perihelion using Python and the principles of general relativity. The goal was to simulate the precession angle and compare it to the actual values observed, leveraging scientific computation tools.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and processed large datasets of perihelion data.
- **Vector Calculations**: Applied vector dot products and Euclidean distance calculations to model Mercury's orbit.
- **Precession Visualization**: Generated plots to visualize the precession over time using Matplotlib.
- **Linear Regression**: Calculated the slope of precession angles using SciPy's linear regression module to demonstrate the effect of general relativity.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
